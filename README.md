# pron

> Pronounces words from the command line by querying and playing Wikimedia audio files.

## What does it do?
Often you can try a non-English word and there will be an available pronounciation — especially in French. There's a lot of audio files [here](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Audio_files_by_language).

## Usage and examples
Try those:
```bash
pron margarine rambunctious
pron Worcestershire
pron karate 椎茸
pron rødgrød_med_fløde
pron Kierkegaard
pron Paris ignorant double_entendre déjà_vu
```

And why not, for a change, pronouncing contents instead of the word proper?
`pron Jabberwocky`
